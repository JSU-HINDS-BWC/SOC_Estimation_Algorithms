Thank you for your interest in contributing to this project! To ensure a smooth and efficient development process, please follow the guidelines below.

## Development Workflow
1. **Create a Development Branch**  
   - Before making any changes, create a new branch from the `main` branch. Use a descriptive name for your branch, such as `feature-new-functionality` or `bugfix-issue123`.

2. **Write Unit Tests**  
   - All new features and bug fixes must include unit tests.
   - Place your unit tests in the `tests/` directory.

3. **Raise a Pull Request (PR)**  
   - Once your changes are complete, create a PR targeting the `main` branch.
   - Ensure your PR includes a clear description of the changes.
   - Your code must pass all existing and new unit tests before submission.

## PR Approval & Merging
- A PR **requires at least 2 approvals** before it can be merged.
- The review process ensures code quality, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.
- Once approved, a maintainer will merge the PR into the `main` branch.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to collaborating with you!
